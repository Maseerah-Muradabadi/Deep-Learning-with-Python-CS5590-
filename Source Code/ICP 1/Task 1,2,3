# Task 1:  State differences between Python 2 and Python 3 version.
# Python 2 Vs Python 3
#  older companies have used python 2 for more than a decade - companies are switching to python 3
#  python 2 libraries are at times incompatible with python 3 - newer libraries built for python 3 work only on it
#  python 2 we need to add a "u" to make a string a unicode as default is ASCII - python 3 strings are unicode and
#                                                                                  unicode is more versatile
# python 2 division rounds to the nearest whole number - python 3 division returns more intuitive decimal in its result
# python 2 print statement is print "hello" - python 3 print statement is print("hello")
# python 2 supports xrange() which outputs iterator object - python 3 does not have xrange()
# python 2 error handling msg".... not defined " - python 3 error handling message "...^ invalid syntax"
# Note: we can use "_future" to import division and print functions of python 3.x into python 2.x code"


# Task 2: Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console,
# delete at least 2 characters,
# reverse the resultant string and print it.

mystring = input("Please enter a string:")
s = mystring
t = s
t = s[0:4]
print(t)


def reverse(string):
    string = "".join(reversed(string))
    return string


print("The original string is : ", t)
print("The reversed string(using reversed) is : ", end="")
print(reverse(t))

# Take two numbers from user and perform arithmetic operations on them.
mynum1 = input('Please enter first num:')
mynum2 = input('Please enter second num:')

num1 = int(mynum1)
num2 = int(mynum2)

add = num1 + num2
sub = num2 - num1
mul = num1 * num2
div = num2 / num1
rem = num1 % num2

print("The arithmetic operations for addition:", add)
print("The arithmetic operations for subtraction:", sub)
print("The arithmetic operations for multiplication:", mul)
print("The arithmetic operations for division:", div)
print("The arithmetic operations for remainder:", rem)

# Task 3: Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’ without
# using regex
mysen = "I love playing with python"
print(mysen.replace("python", "pythons"))
